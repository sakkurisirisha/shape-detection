# Draw and Detect Shape using OpenCV

This is a Python-based project using OpenCV that allows users to draw shapes on a canvas using their mouse. The tool detects and classifies the shape based on its vertices and geometry. Supported shapes include common polygons like triangle, square, rectangle, diamond, pentagon, hexagon, octagon, and circle.

# How it Works

Canvas: A blank canvas opens for drawing.

Draw Shapes: Use the mouse to draw shapes on the canvas by clicking and dragging.

Detect Shape: Press the d key to detect the shape after drawing.

Clear Canvas: Press the c key to clear the canvas and draw a new shape.

Quit: Press the q key to close the application.

# Requirements

Python 3.x

OpenCV (pip install opencv-python)

NumPy (pip install numpy)

# How to Run

Clone the repository or download the code.

Install the dependencies by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the script:
python draw_and_detect_shape.py

# Features

Detects Triangle, Square, Rectangle, Diamond, Pentagon, Hexagon, Octagon, and Circle.

Easy mouse-based interaction to draw shapes.

Shape detection includes circularity check for accurate Circle detection.

Clear canvas feature to reset the drawing area.

Real-time shape feedback when the drawing is complete.

# Future Improvements

Support for more complex shapes.

Advanced shape detection algorithms for irregular shapes.

Color options for both drawing and detecting shapes.

More interactive features such as shape resizing and rotating.
